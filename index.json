[{"categories":null,"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;m Ryan, I Really Like Beer This blog is the personal project of Ryan Stewart. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived in Ballard for almost 20 years and have been into craft beer for almost as long. I\u0026rsquo;ve watched enthusiastically as Ballard has become a beer destination and have tried to enjoy as much of the beer as I can.\nI tried my hand at homebrewing but realized that there so many better beers to drink around Ballard so focused my efforts on learning as much about beer as I can. I work in tech for Okta, so I\u0026rsquo;m not in the industry, but just enjoy nerding out about beer when I can. I wanted an excuse to write and learn more about beer while contributing back to the zeitgeist, so the blog was born.\nFor the most part, this blog will be reviews of various beers or beer drinking spots in Ballard. Once travelling opens up, I may also take some time to write about beer in other parts of the country and world. If you see me out and about in Ballard, feel free to say hello or share some beer knowledge.\n","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":["Beer Reviews"],"contents":"One of my favorite things about living in a place with numerous breweries that are generally doing creative things is that I get exposed to a number of rare or historic beer styles. This also gives me an opportunity to learn more about the history and evolution of beer. A perfect example of that is Fair Isle\u0026rsquo;s Franz Meredith, which is a Grodziskie inspired Saison.\nGrodziskie has a great wikipedia page which breaks down the history of the beer. It\u0026rsquo;s also got its own BJCP category, 27A Historical Beer: Piwo Grodziskie. Fair Isle does explicitly mention that Franz Meredith is Grodziskie inspired, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to fully replicate the style, but from what I could read up on the beer style, it does a pretty good job of hitting the main points.\nGrodziskie is a beer style from Poland that stands out because of it\u0026rsquo;s oaked smoked wheat malt. The Franz Meredith shines here by using 85% oak smoked wheat and 15% malted white wheat. Both of which, I think come from Skagit Valley Malting, which I love to see. Even my terrible nose gets a very nice smokey aroma after pouring. I should admit to being a huge smoke fan for my food and beverages, so if smoke isn\u0026rsquo;t your thing, this beer may not be up your alley. The smoke also hits perfectly on first sip and blends nicely with the subtle fruit flavors to create what I can only describe as a bright, refreshing campfire experience. I find the smoke lingers for a little bit giving the beer a very interesting bitterness towards the end.\nThe style is associated with a very specific town in Poland, Grodzisk Weilkopolski and with its distinctive flavor and potentially because of the water in the region, became a well known and sought after beer across the country. A guild formed in the city that governed the brewing of the style and implemented some quality control. According to the History of Gratzer beer via Wikipedia the mayor and a town council had the job of tasting and evaluating each barrel and stamping approved Grodziskie beer. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it. Production of the style continued into the 1800s after the town became part of Prussia and then independant Poland while the town became \u0026ldquo;Gratz\u0026rdquo; and the style \u0026ldquo;Gratzer\u0026rdquo; which I think I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a couple of places over the years. It\u0026rsquo;s peak came just before World War II and when the breweries were nationalized following WWII, the style faded away but has made a bit of a recovery.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a low alcohol beer, which Franz Meredith adheres to, clocking in at 3.6% ABV which makes it a perfect refreshing summer beer. The style is supposed to be highly carbonated and I found Fair Isle\u0026rsquo;s interpretation to match that very well. The main noticeable difference is that the style is meant to be very clear but Fair Isle\u0026rsquo;s has a bit of a haze, presumably because it isn\u0026rsquo;t filtered. Like any good Saison, the hops play a supporting role in this beer. They\u0026rsquo;re using Strissel Spalt, a French aroma hop and Hull Melon, a newer German hop, making this beer very Euro-centric. I get a smokey, grassy, farmhouse funk when I drink it, but the hops are meant to impart a melon and apricot flavor. I definitely get a tang of fruit, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;m sophisticated enough to pull out the melon flavors specficially.\nAll of this comes together perfectly in this beer and provides for a light, refreshing, bright beer with a touch of smoke and a fascinating historical background. Grab it while they\u0026rsquo;ve got it.\n","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/blog/fair-isle-franz-meredith/","tags":["Beer Reviews","Fair Isle"],"title":"Fair Isle Franz Meredith Review"},{"categories":["Beer Reviews"],"contents":"Stoup\u0026rsquo;s Neck Tats Double IPA is one of my favorite Ballard beers and also one of the best named. I find it to be a terrifyingly drinkable DIPA that has a danky, grapefruit bitterness that I love in my big IPAs. It also, it turns out, is a testament to science, or maybe just modern brewing.\nThe Stoup site has the following info about Neck Tats:\n Double IPA equals double the hop pleasure! This beer is bittered with Simcoe then Citra Cryo, Mosaic Incognito and Simcoe Resinate hops are added in the whirlpool. Copious amounts of Mosaic, Bru-1 and more Citra Cryo additions in the dry hop results in layers of hop goodness.\n I consider myself a decently savvy beer nerd, and while I recognized the hops, I realized there were also a bunch of words I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know the meaning of. Starting with Cryo, but including Incognito and Resinate. And as it turns out, in addition to being a symphony of hop varieties, it\u0026rsquo;s also notable for the number of hop extraction methods it showcases.\nBased on the description, it starts off with basic Simcoe for bittering. I love Simcoe as a hop. Given everything going on with this beer, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to pull out a specific flavor, but bittering doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave much flavor anyway. Suffice to say, I think the Simcoe gives it a great bite. Then things get interesting. It says during the whirlpool, which happens after the wort is done boiling but before it is chilled. The basic idea is that by adding hops at a lower, below boiling temperature, you get more aroma and flavor from the hops because adding hops at boiling will make the beer more bitter but not retain much flavor. At lower temperatures, the opposite is true because the hop essential oils don\u0026rsquo;t evaporate. What\u0026rsquo;s fascinating about this beer is what they did to get the hop oils.\nFrom Yakima Chief\u0026rsquo;s blog post on Cryo hops\nFirst up are the Citra Cryo. I\u0026rsquo;d heard about Cryo Hops but hadn\u0026rsquo;t ever dug in to understand them better. The linked blog post has a great description. Essentially, they use liquid nitrogen on the hops to freeze them. While in that state they separate the parts that contain the hop oil, the lupulin glands, create a powder, then form the powder into pellets. So you get a potent powder of all the hop goodness without having to deal with other parts of the hop plant which ultimately soak up (waste beer). Which means more of the beer you brew you get to use. For Neck Tats, they also use Mosaic Incognito, which I had never heard of before. Incognito is an even more efficient way to inject a beer with hop flavor. Developed by John I Haas, it\u0026rsquo;s basically an insanely pure form of hop oil that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any \u0026ldquo;vegitative material\u0026rdquo; which ends up absorbing and wasting beer. According to the promo video, it\u0026rsquo;s specifically tailored to go in at the whirlpool stage so you can maximize flavor and aroma. Then there is the Resinate, which from what I can tell, is an extraction process that uses C02 to create very pure botanical oils. It\u0026rsquo;s has similar benefits to Incognito in terms of being able to maximize flavor without wasting beer.\nThen they throw more Mosaic, Citra, and Bru-1, which gets used a lot with Hazy beers. For the dry hop, it\u0026rsquo;s primarily about aroma, and I have a terrible, terrible sense of smell, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pull out a specific aroma. But the Bru-1 is supposed to have a \u0026ldquo;sweet fruit aroma\u0026rdquo; alongside the fruit aroma of the Mosaic and the citrus smell from the Citra hops. It all works, especially as the beer warms up, I just know my nose can\u0026rsquo;t do it justice.\nNeck Tats lives up to Stoup\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Art \u0026amp; Science of Beer\u0026rdquo; tagline. I had no idea that hop infusions had gotten so varied and that those variations would not only contribute to cleaner flavors, but more beer. Now I want to see if I can find some comparisons to set up beers with similar hop compositions but with more traditional brewing methods against the new, fancy stuff.\n","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/blog/stoup-neck-tats-double-ipa/","tags":["Beer Reviews","Stoup"],"title":"Stoup Neck Tats Double IPA Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Feel free to drop me a note.\n","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/contact/","tags":null,"title":"Contact"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/homepage/home-1/","tags":null,"title":"Homepage 1"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/homepage/home-2/","tags":null,"title":"Homepage 2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://www.ballardbeerblog.com/search/","tags":null,"title":"Search Result"}]
